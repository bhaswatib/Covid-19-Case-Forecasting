# Covid-19-Case-Number-Forecasting
This project involves pre-processing of time series datasets to prepare and calculate the needed measures for using them to build a regression model.
The dataset used is the Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset from Kaggle. The three files used from the dataset are:
1. Time series Covid 19 confirmed cases which consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each country.
2. Time series Covid 19 deaths which consists of the data related to the cumulative number of deaths, per day, in each country.
3. Time series Covid 19 recoveries which consists of the data related to the cumulative number of recovered cases, per day, in each country.
